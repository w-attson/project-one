Scope and Purpose 

This project aims to analyse the risk of deaths and hospitalisation arising from motor vehicle accidents and see how their costs to society are distributed by several factors:

Area - regions, highways, locations
Speed
Weather
Whether the dead is the driver or the passenger or pedestrian
Demographics - sex, age, 
kinds/types of vehicle


Sources of Data:

https://dtp.vic.gov.au/about/data-and-research/vista/vista-data-and-publications
https://www.bitre.gov.au/statistics/safety/fatal_road_crash_database

The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data



Fintech Product Ideas

Creating a bond which has a coupon which falls as the number of incidents in a local area fall
Creating a weighted number which indicates the likelihood of an individual being a victim of a fatal car crash, and using this number to help insurance companies determine premiums.
